Difference about Accounting vs. Finance
The Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

The Financial Equation:
Income = Revenue - Cost

Accounting is not concerned with performance
Accounting is not concerned with income, revenue
They don't care, ideally if you make a profit or you make a loss,
not the job of accounting. Accounting is the murder mystery. Accounting
is who-done-it, right? Where was the money spent? Where did it go? Why
did it go there? How did it go there? Accounting tracks what's happening,
financially, in the institution, and should be unbiased as to whether
performance has been high, performance has been low. Ideally, accounting
is not concerned with these things. Accounting is simply tracking it.
Finance, what's the financial equation? Income equals, what are we after?
money, money, money. We want to be profitable. If we're not profitable,
we wanna know why and accounting can often help us there.
The major difference between accounting and finance is accounting is
tracking things. And finance is using what we're tracking to determine how
we can get those costs reduced, how we can get that revenue increased, and
how we can increase that bottom line of income, which equals revenue minus cost.
