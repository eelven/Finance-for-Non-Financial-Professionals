1.1 The Building Block of Accounting (5min)

The Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

The balance sheet is one of the 4 financial statements
Traditionally, the balance sheet was done with two sides:
You had the left hand side, assets, and on the right hand
side you'd have liabilities and equity.

Assets: What I have
Liabilities: What I owe
Equity: What I own

1.2 Overview of the Finance Principles (4min)

The financial Equation:
Income = Revenue - Cost
Revenue = Price x Volume
Cost = Fixed + Variable

Difference about Accounting vs. Finance
The Accounting Equation:
Assets = Liabilities + Equity

The Financial Equation:
Income = Revenue - Cost

Accounting is not concerned with performance
Accounting is not concerned with income, revenue
They don't care, ideally if you make a profit or you make a loss,
not the job of accounting. Accounting is the murder mystery. Accounting
is who-done-it, right? Where was the money spent? Where did it go? Why
did it go there? How did it go there? Accounting tracks what's happening,
financially, in the institution, and should be unbiased as to whether
performance has been high, performance has been low. Ideally, accounting
is not concerned with these things. Accounting is simply tracking it.
Finance, what's the financial equation? Income equals, what are we after?
money, money, money. We want to be profitable. If we're not profitable,
we wanna know why and accounting can often help us there.
The major difference between accounting and finance is accounting is
tracking things. And finance is using what we're tracking to determine how
we can get those costs reduced, how we can get that revenue increased, and
how we can increase that bottom line of income, which equals revenue minus cost.

1.3 The Four Financial Statements (9min)

The Four Financial Statements
1-Balance Sheet
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
The Balance Sheet is a snapshot of a company at any given moment in time

2-Income Statement
Income  = Revenue - Cost
The Income Statement takes place over a period of time, and the period of 
time depends on you, what you want? You can run an Income Statement from
the very first transaction that was ever conducted in the business.
We do Income Statement for quarters and Income Statements for a year.
We specify the duration, the time frame that we're gonna look at. And then
during that time frame, the Income Statement, it lists alll of the different
sources of revenues, all of the different sources of costs and subtracts the
costs from the revenues, arrives at the income. How much money did we make?

3-Cash Flow Statement
Cash Flow Statement tracks our cash. 
Depreciation

4-Shareholder's Equity
Shows the nature of the equity in the company
Assets = Liabilities + Equity
The equity is the ownership of the company

These are the statements that we use in analyzing, evaluating companies and
doing our accounting. Accounting is the department that puts those statements
together and then finance often uses those statements to evaluate the business
to see how the business is doing, to run the different ratios and investors
use those statements to make their investment decisions.

1.4 The Practice of Accounting (16min)

GAAP: Generally accepted accounting principles
FASB: Financial Accounting Standards Board

These organizations put out guidelines and help enforce the rules of accounting and
make sure that accountants are accounting the way the should be.

Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP)
.Historical Cost Principle
.Revenue Recognition Principle
.Matching Principle
.Full Disclosure
.Materially Principle
.Consistency Principle
.Conservatism Principle

Historical Cost Principle
Requires companies to account and report based on acquisition costs rather than fair
market value for most assets and liabilities.

Revenue Recognition Principle
.Companies must record revenue when it is earned
.The flow of cash does not have any bearing on the recognition of revenue
.This is the essence of accrual basis accounting.
.Conversely, losses must be recognized when their occurrence becomes probable, whether or
not it has actually occurred.

Matching principle
.Expenses have to be matched with revenues
.Expenses are recognized when the work or the product actually makes its contribution to revenue
.Depreciation and Cost of Goods Sold are good examples of application of this principle.

Full disclosure principle
Amount and kinds of information disclosed should be decided based on trade-off analysis as a larger
amount of information costs more to prepare and use.

Materiality principle
The significance of an item should be considered when it is reported.

Consistency principle
A company must use the same accounting principles and methods from period to period

Inventory Valuation 
.FIFO = First in First Out
.LIFO = Last in First Out
.Average Cost

Conservatism Principle
When choosing between two solutions, the one which has the less favorable outcome is the solution
which should be chosen.
