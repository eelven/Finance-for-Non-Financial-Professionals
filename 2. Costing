2.1 Costing Methods (6min)

3 different methods of costing
3 Costing Methods:
-Process Costing
-Standard Costing
-Job Order Costing

Process Costing
A method in cost accounting for collecting and assigning manufacturing
costs to the units produced.

It is used when nearly identical units are mass produced.

Price per Unit = 

Direct Costs        Overhead Costs
---------------  +  ---------------
#Units Produced     #Units Produced

Standard Costing
Method for assigning costs by using average or standard costs rather than
actual costs of direct material, labor and overhead

.Differences between actual costs and standard cost are known as variances

Job Order Costing
A system for assigning manufacturing costs to an individual product or batches
of products.
.Generally, used only when the products manufactured are sufficiently different
from each other.
