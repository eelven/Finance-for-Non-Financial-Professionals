Costing (25min.)

2.1 Costing Methods (6min)

3 different methods of costing
3 Costing Methods:
-Process Costing
-Standard Costing
-Job Order Costing

Process Costing
A method in cost accounting for collecting and assigning manufacturing
costs to the units produced.

It is used when nearly identical units are mass produced.

Price per Unit = 

Direct Costs        Overhead Costs
---------------  +  ---------------
#Units Produced     #Units Produced

Standard Costing
Method for assigning costs by using average or standard costs rather than
actual costs of direct material, labor and overhead

.Differences between actual costs and standard cost are known as variances

Job Order Costing
A system for assigning manufacturing costs to an individual product or batches
of products.
.Generally, used only when the products manufactured are sufficiently different
from each other.

2.2 Cost Allocation (3min)

The 3 primary ways of allocating the cost to what it is we're producing
Direct Costing
Uses only cost directly attributable to the product or service
A lot of times we can call direct costs variable costs, the costs that will go up
and down based on the quantity that I produce.

Absorption Costing
Uses direct costs and some of the overhead costs.
Absorption costing says that I'm going to absorb some or all of my non-direct costs.


Full Costing
Uses direct costs and all overhead costs
Full costing is absorption costing, but you're absorbing everything because sometimes
we abosb some indirect cost and sometimes we absorb all of our indirect costs.

2.3 Break-Even Analysis (7min)

Break-Even is a great word in business, we use it all the time (video 0:18)
a Break-Even of the operating of business, of a company performance.

Calculating Break-Even
.Technique associated with a direct costing approach
How many x product do I need to sell ( in this case) in a calendar month for example.
to neither make money or lose money? Where is my Break-Even.

.Requires a company to classify costs as either:
..Fixed Costs - Costs uninfluenced by volume of output and/or sales
..Variable Costs - Costs that vary directly with volume of output and/or sales

This can be a subjective division, a lot of times you can take a cost that's variable
and throw it into fixed, coz, it's easier that way. Or take a cost that's really, 
by nature, fixed, but we're gonna make that variable, because it's easier.
What's important is that you've properly identified what your costs are.

Break-Even Example
Selling price = $10 per pizza
Cost of ingredients = $3.60 per pizza
Contribution = $6.40 per pizza
Fixed Costs = $4,000 /month

Break Even = Fixed Costs / Contribution

Break Even = $4,000/$6.40  = 625 pizzas sold or $6,250

Standard Break-Even = 625 pizzas sold 
Monetary Break-Even = $6,250

2.4 Pricing (3min)

Cost help us strategize prices
Pricing
Revenue = Price x Volume

Absorption Costing
Some overhead costs are absorbed by the units peoduced.

With full costing, each product contributes to EBITDA.

Cost - Price - Strategy
Costing methods drive pricing strategies
Pricing strategies must be congruent with the business environment
Understanding costing (and thus pricing) options allow us to better
respond to the demands of our sector.
