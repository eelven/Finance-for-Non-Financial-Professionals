1. Market Valuation

.Simplest way to value a publicly traded firm

Equity market value of company = Price of a single share X Number of outstanding shares

Ex.) Market Valuation 
GAP Inc. has ...
. 1,106,000 shares outsanding
. A current market value of $43.10
Market Cap for GAP Inc = 1,106,000 shares X $43.10 / share = $47,668,600

The Market Cap is:
.Rarely considered to be the true market value of a company for valuation purposes
.Driven by the stock price which is driven by investors
.Used to determine whether a stock is over or under-valued
.Used in other, more thorough valuation processes

4.2 Valuation Methods (9min)

Valuation Methods
1. Market Valuation
2. Multiples Method
3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis

2. Multiples Method
.Useful for comparing companies in a sector
.Look at which multiples are used for other companies in the industry to ascertain equity value
.Examples of these valuation multiples include:
..Price/earning multiples (P/E ratios)
..EBITDA multiples

Ex.) Multiples Method
What is the value of Company A which has:
.Debt = $100 million
.Annual sales = $180 million
.EBITDA = $70 million
.Earnings = $40 million

Common Stock Comparison
Company|Value(Market Cap)|Sales|EBITDA|Earnings|
1           900             220   115     82
2           700             190   90      60
3           650             280   68      42
4           320             150   45      26

Multiples
Company|Sales Multiples(Market Cap/Sales)|EBITDA|Price to Earnings Multiples (market Cap/ Earnings)|
1             4.1                           7.8             11.0
2             3.7                           7.8             11.7
3             2.3                           9.6             15.5
4             2.1                           7.1             12.3
Average       3.1                           8.1             12.6

Multiples Valuation
Using the sales multiple:
Company A's sales of $180 million x 3.1 (average sales multiple) = $558 million (Enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $458 million (Equity Value)

Using the EBITDA multiple:
Company A's EBITDA of $70 million x 8.1 (average EBITDA multiple) = $565 million (enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $465 million (Equity Value)

Using the price-to-earning multiple:
Company A's earning of $40 million x 12.6 (average price-to-earning multiple) = $504 million (Enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $404 million (Equity Value)

Using the multiples method:
Enterprise Value of our company is estimated at between $505 and $565 million
Accounting for debt, our company's Equity Value is between $405 and $465 million dollars

4.3 NPV and IRR (15min)

3. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)
. A very thorough way to value a company
. Uses a company's free cash flow and a discount rate to calculate the Net Present Value (NPV)
. Free cash flows can be used to calculate the Internal Rate of Return (IRR)

Net Present Value (NPV)
Using the time value of money concept, NPV tells us what the future cash flows of the company
are worth in "today's money"

Net Present Value(NPV)
.Takes into account the company's current cost of capital in the form of WACC (weighted average cost of capital)

Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
.IRR is the yield of an investiment expressed as a percentage
.If the IRR is greater than WACC (i.e. IRR > WACC), then the project's rate of return is greater than its costs.

NPV vs IRR
.Entrepreneurs and investors tend to prefer NPV
.Managers tend to like IRR
.IRR gives an investment yield as a percentage while NPV gives an actual monetary amount
.Only NPV can actually value an investment
.If cash flows go positive and then again drop into the negative, the IRR equation can be flawed.
.At that point, often only NPV can offer a credible value

Relationship between NPV and IRR
.IRR is the discount rat at which the NPV = 0
.If the IRR is 21% and calculating the NPV using a 21% discount rate, then NPV should equal "0".
.Excel has functions to calculate both NPV and IRR

Discount Rate
.A monetization of risk associated with a venture
.Cash flow are discounted by this rate to determine present value "net of risk"
.At the lowest, we use inflation, at the highest, we use speculated risk
.For an existing business, we can use WACC (the risk assigned by the market)

Ex.) Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
Debt structure of a company:
45% debt at 6% interest
55% common equity at 13%

WACC = (0.45 x 6%) + (0.55 x 13%) = 2.7% + 7.15% = 9.85%
* This company should take projects that have estimated returns above 9.85%
