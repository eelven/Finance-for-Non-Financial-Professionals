2           700             190   90      60
3           650             280   68      42
4           320             150   45      26

Multiples
Company|Sales Multiples(Market Cap/Sales)|EBITDA|Price to Earnings Multiples (market Cap/ Earnings)|
1             4.1                           7.8             11.0
2             3.7                           7.8             11.7
3             2.3                           9.6             15.5
4             2.1                           7.1             12.3
Average       3.1                           8.1             12.6

Multiples Valuation
Using the sales multiple:
Company A's sales of $180 million x 3.1 (average sales multiple) = $558 million (Enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $458 million (Equity Value)

Using the EBITDA multiple:
Company A's EBITDA of $70 million x 8.1 (average EBITDA multiple) = $565 million (enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $465 million (Equity Value)

Using the price-to-earning multiple:
Company A's earning of $40 million x 12.6 (average price-to-earning multiple) = $504 million (Enterprise Value) - $100 million (Net Debt) = $404 million (Equity Value)

Using the multiples method:
Enterprise Value of our company is estimated at between $505 and $565 million
Accounting for debt, our company's Equity Value is between $405 and $465 million dollars
